          I'm a <span class="blue-text">Computer Science</span> student somewhere
          in Nigeria and a Software Engineer. I enjoy <span class="blue-text"
            >building</span
          > things that run on computers and exploring a lot (or a bit) of other
          tools, languages etc while doing that. I also do enjoy experimenting a
          lot (unfortunately, a lot of these stay private on my Github profile) and
          I would gladly stay up all night learning how to write the best software
          I possibly can and how to make it run even better; "good" isn't enough.

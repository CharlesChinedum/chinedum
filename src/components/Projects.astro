            During my free time, I like to <span class="blue-text">build</span> things
            that I find interesting and/or would use; sometimes to learn more about
            something or just to fix a problem that's particularly frustrated me
            enough at that point in time. Here are a couple of them, you can find
            other random things I build on my <span class="blue-text"
              >Github</span
            > page.

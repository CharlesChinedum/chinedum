              Like I said I love to build things. I have <span

                built
              </span>
              a lot of things in my spare time. Some of them are simple, some of
              them are complex. Some of them are finished, some of them are not.
              Some of them are public, some of them are private. Some of them are
              for <span class="blue-text">fun</span>, some of them are for work.
              Some of them are for <span class="blue-text">learning</span>, some
              of them are found here.

# What now?

Tbh, I've been starring at this page for a while now. I'm not sure what to write here. I guess I'll just start with a little bit about myself. Well I am a Software Engineer, yeah, you probably knew that already. But for sometime I've been dealing with imposter syndrome, and inconsistency. I've been trying to find a way to deal with it, and I think I've found it. I've decided to start writing about my journey as a Software Engineer, and the things I've learnt along the way. I hope you find it useful. I'll be writing about things like: A project I am working on, A language or framework I used recently, and generally anything I find interesting. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading.

console.log("See You Soon!");
